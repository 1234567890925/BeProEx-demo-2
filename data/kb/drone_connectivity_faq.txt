# Drone Connectivity FAQ

Q1: The drone won't connect to the app.
A1:
1) Confirm Bluetooth is enabled on the phone.
2) Make sure no other phone is paired with the drone; if paired, unpair from that phone.
3) Power cycle both the drone and the phone.
4) In the app, go to Settings → Devices and remove old entries for the drone.
5) Retry pairing within 2 meters; avoid strong Wi‑Fi interference sources (routers, microwaves).

Q2: The app can see the drone, but pairing fails at 90%.
A2:
- Update the app to the latest version.
- Check if phone OS has pending Bluetooth permissions.
- If it still fails, perform a factory reset on the drone and pair again.

Q3: Video feed is laggy after pairing.
A3:
- Ensure the battery is above 30%.
- Avoid congested 2.4 GHz environments; switch the app's stream quality to 'Auto'.
- Keep direct line-of-sight within 20 meters.
