# Drone Getting Started (Product A)

## App Pairing Basics
- Ensure your mobile device's Bluetooth is ON.
- The drone should be powered on and within 2 meters of the phone.
- Open the Innovate Inc. mobile app and navigate to: Settings → Devices → Add Drone.
- When prompted, allow the app to access Bluetooth and Location.
- First-time pairing may take up to 30 seconds.

## Power & Battery
- Charge the battery fully before first use (LED turns solid green).
- If LEDs flash red, battery is under 15% — pair near a charger or replace the pack.
- Power cycle: turn the drone OFF, wait 10 seconds, turn it ON.

## Factory Reset
- Hold the power button for 12 seconds until LEDs blink blue-green.
- After reset, re-pair the drone via the app.
